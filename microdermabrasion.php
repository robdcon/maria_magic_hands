The <a class='skinbase' href='http://www.skinbase.co.uk' rel='noopener'>Skinbase&trade;</a> Microdermabrasion Facial is a safe, controlled treatment that intensely exfoliates and resurfaces the skin.  <br><br>It’s the leading skincare treatment in the UK & Ireland for complete skin rejuvenation. A fine jet of abrasive crystals gently removes dead skin cells layer by layer and a vacuum action lifts away the debris, stimulating the blood flow and encouraging collagen and elastin formation that results in firmer, revitalised and youthful looking skin. <br><br>Fine lines disappear, acne scarring is reduced and dull and tired skin is completely banished – sometimes after just one treatment.
<br><br>Effects are usually seen after the first treatment, with ongoing improvements seen week after week during a course. <br><br>Microdermabrasion facials can be had as just a one off treatment to revive dull skin, however we advise purchasing a course of treatments to get maximum results. Usually, this will consist of 6 to 8 treatments, 7 to 10 days apart.  <br><br>Skin problems such as acne or acne scarring, or deeper forehead wrinkles may require slightly more sessions to achieve full improvements.  <br><br>After a course is completed, a single monthly treatment will maintain your skin’s improvements.
A patch test is required before this treatment
